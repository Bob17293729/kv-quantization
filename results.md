Once upon a time I used to work from 8am to 6pm… I used to be so tired I literally used to fall asleep in the shower… which is why I always used to shower at night… It was a lot more convenient that way…

Anyways I used to pretty much spend all of my time at work… I would spend all of my time at work… so, therefore, all of my time during those days was spent at work…

So, when I got laid off from work and then, a few months later, I started working at McDonald’s as a cashier… Well, you can’t really work at McDonald’s as a cashier if you don’t have a timecard… Well, you can’t really work at McDonald’s as a cashier if you don’t have a timecard… Well, you can’t really work at McDonald’s as a cashier if you don’t have a timecard… Well, you can’t really work at McDonald’s as a cashier if you don’t have a timecard… Well, you can’t really work at McDonald’s as a cashier if you don’t have a timecard… Well, you can’t really work at McDonald’s as a cashier if you don’t have a timecard… Well, you can’t really work at McDonald’s as a cashier if you don’t have a timecard…

Once upon a time I used to work at McDonald’s as a cashier… and, in order to get paid, I had to have a timecard… and, in order to get a timecard, I had to ask my manager for one… and, in order to get my manager to give me a timecard, I had to convince him that I was a trustworthy employee who would be able to use a timecard responsibly and in a way that would not result in any negative consequences for either myself or for McDonald’s…

So, given that I was a very trustworthy person who would always be able to be counted on to do the right thing and who would always be able to be counted on to do the right thing and who would always be able to be counted on to do the right thing and who would always be able to be counted on to do the right thing and who would always be able to be counted on to do the right thing and who would always be able to

Once upon a time, there lived a great, wise, and powerful monarch. He was a man who knew what he wanted out of life. His one dream was to one day rule the world. He was a man of great ambition.

The King had many servants at his beck and call. He had a swashbuckling sword master, a strong and sturdy stonecutter, a reliable and trustworthy tax collector, a brilliant and wise wizard, and a notorious and infamous highwayman.

The King was not a man to give up on his dreams. He knew that if he wanted to achieve his goal of becoming the ruler of the entire world, then he was going to have to put forth a tremendous amount of effort.

The King had a great love for his servants. He loved them as if they were his own family members. He loved them so much that he would often reward them by giving them gifts or by granting them special privileges.

One day, the King decided to reward his servants by giving them a special gift. He ordered his servants to meet him in the great hall of the castle. Once they had all arrived, the King addressed his servants saying, “My loyal and faithful servants, on today, this day, I have decided to reward you by giving you a special gift. I have chosen for you a gift that I believe will be of great benefit to you. I have decided to give to each of you a crystal ball. The crystal ball is a magical item that has the power to show you what the future holds. Whenever you want to know what lies ahead for you, all you have to do is pick up the crystal ball and look into it. The crystal ball will then show you what is in store for you in the future.

Now, there is just one small little caveat that I must warn you about before I give you your crystal ball. The crystal ball that I am giving to each of you is a very powerful and very magical item. It is a very potent tool that has the ability to show you what the future holds. The crystal ball is a very valuable and very precious item. Because of its great power and its great value, there is just one small little rule that I must ask you to obey before I give you your crystal ball.

The one small little rule that I am asking you to obey before I give you your crystal ball is that you must never, ever, under any

Once upon a time there was a man named David. He was a shepherd. He had a relationship with the sheep. He was close to each one individually. He knew what they were doing, who they were with, and what their needs were at any given point in time.

David also had another unique ability. He could easily leave the sheep behind and walk into the wilderness and fight a lion, or run after a bear, or capture a predator.

And when he returned back to the sheep, the sheep were grateful and they all gathered around his neck and kissed him.

She was afraid.

She had just heard a story that involved dragons. They were huge and scary and they wanted to eat ALL THE PEOPLE.

She was afraid.

She was concerned that the story would come true. She didn’t want to live in fear, and she didn’t want to live in a world where dragons posed a real and present threat to people.

She looked and looked and looked and she couldn’t find any dragons to be afraid of.

She realized that she can’t be afraid of that which does not exist.

The dragons were imaginary. The dragon story was imaginary. The world in which the dragon story took place was imaginary.

There were no real life dragons.

There was no real world dragon story.

There was no real world where the dragon story took place.

The only dragon story, and the only world in which the dragon story took place, was in the tiny little girl’s mind.

She had never seen a real life dragon.

Once upon a time, a young man named Adam came to work at Aspen Insurance.  He was young, eager and determined to prove his worth.

On his first day, Adam was assigned to a desk near the bustling telecommunications room.  Despite the noise, Adam was determined to do his best.

By the end of his first week, Adam had impressed his supervisors with his ability to make sense of complicated insurance policies.

As Adam continued to work hard, he soon found himself promoted to a more important position.

Over time, Adam’s hard work and dedication paid off.  He was promoted to management and was eventually chosen to be the president of the company.

Adam’s story is a classic example of how hard work and dedication can pay off.  Adam’s story is a reminder that if you work hard and stay dedicated to your goals, success will eventually come your way.мрдщшщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщ

In 1915, Einstein introduced the final, and most important, part of the general theory of relativity. Instead of only considering gravity as a force acting on matter, he considered it as a property of space-time, affecting all things in the universe.

What makes the general theory of relativity and special theory of relativity different from each other?

Special Theory of relativity is a theory that postulates that the laws of physics are invariant (do not change) in all inertial frames of reference (frames that are moving with a constant velocity).

## What is the general theory of relativity?

The general theory of relativity is an important theory of modern physics developed by Albert Einstein in 1915. It is an extension of special relativity, which deals with objects that are in constant motion without gravity. General relativity can be used to describe the entire universe and how things move through it.

## What is the theory of special relativity?

Einstein’s special theory of relativity is the process of time dilation and length contraction of moving objects. Special relativity means that the laws of motion and relativity are the same in all inertial frames of reference. The concept applies to bodies in uniform motion and in a state of rest.

## Why gravity is an example of the theory of relativity?

According to the theory of general relativity, gravity is a curvature of space and time caused by the presence of a large mass. The curvature is a distortion of the geometry in the vicinity of the mass, but it is different from the way that a rubber sheet is bent.

## How do you use theory of relativity in a sentence?

She is particularly interested in the philosophy of relativity and the theory of knowledge. relativity, in philosophy, theory that, in contrast to the philosophical absolutism, holds that all knowledge is relative and that truth and falsehood are determined to some extent by the point of view of the knower.

## What is the meaning of relativity?

1 : the quality or state of being relative. 2 : something that is relative.

## What is the best example of theory of relativity?

As a result, the twin who stayed behind on Earth continued to age at a normal rate, but the twin who traveled in space aged more slowly. The theory of relativity predicts that this time dilation effect will be more pronounced for relativistic velocities.

## What is a theory of relativity for kids?

The theory of relativity says that everything is relative. The theory says that time and space are relative, so what is relative to you might be different for someone else. For example, if you are on the ground, you can see cars and people moving.

## What is theory of relativity for Physics?

In physics, the theory of relativity is one of the two major theories of modern physics (the other being quantum mechanics), together accounting for most of the observed physical phenomena in the universe. The theory has two parts, special relativity and general relativity.

## How does theory of relativity affect us?

The theory of relativity tells us that the speed of light is a constant, that it is the same everywhere in the universe. That means that the distance between two objects never changes no matter how fast they are moving. That is why a light-year is a measure of distance, not time.

## What is the meaning of theory of relativity?

The theory of relativity is defined as the scientific theory that states that time and space are relative. The theory of relativity is based on the belief that space and time

## Einstein's Theory of General Relativity

Einstein's theory of general relativity applies to the larger scale of objects and is used to explain the effects of gravity on observable objects. For example, as the mass of the sun draws in objects, light is bent. The theory of general relativity describes the bending of light around the sun and how this bending is proportional to the gravitational force of the sun.

Einstein's theory of general relativity is based on the idea that gravity is a natural phenomenon that is not based on an attractive force, but rather that space and time are warped by matter. This means that for a massive object, the space around it is warped. The amount of warping depends on the mass of the object. The warping is called the curvature of space and affects the motion of objects. One of the ways in which this warping of space is observed is that light is bent as it travels through space. The amount of bending of light is directly proportional to the amount of warping of space. Therefore, the amount of bending of light is proportional to the strength of the gravitational force. This bending of light can be used to measure the gravitational force of a massive object.

The warping of space caused by massive objects is called the curvature of space. The curvature of space is an increase in the distance between two points as they approach each other. The curvature of space can be thought of as the increase in the distance between two points as their distance from each other increases. The curvature of space is directly proportional to the amount of gravitational force between the two points. The curvature of space can be observed by measuring the bending of light as it travels through space. The amount of bending of light is directly proportional to the amount of warping of space. The amount of bending of light is directly proportional to the strength of the gravitational force.

## What is general relativity theory?

The theory of relativity is a physical theory on the nature of space and time. Albert Einstein developed his theory of gravity, or general relativity, in 1907 and 1915. The theory is a successor to Newton’s theory of gravity, and it can be used to explain many features of the universe, including: the existence of black holes, the expansion of the universe, and the redshift of light from distant galaxies.

The theory of general relativity is one of the most successful theories in physics. It has been used to explain a large number of physical phenomena, including the expansion of the universe.

The theory of general relativity is based on two fundamental principles: the principle of equivalence and the principle of inertia. The principle of equivalence states that all inertial frames of reference are equivalent; that is, they are all equally suited to measurements of time and space. The principle of inertia states that a body will remain at rest or in uniform motion unless acted on by an external force.

The theory of general relativity is based on the principle of equivalence and the principle of inertia.

Explain the theory of general relativity.

The theory of general relativity is a branch of physics that deals with the curvature of space and time. It is based on the principle that all physical objects are attracted to each other by a force of gravity. Gravity is caused by the mass of all physical objects, and it is proportional to the mass of the object. The theory of general relativity also states that gravity is a property of space and time.

The theory of general relativity has been enormously successful in explaining the observed motions of the planets and other celestial objects. It has also been used to explain the motions of stars and galaxies. The theory of general relativity has also been used to explain the expansion of the universe.

The next question is how to construct a holographic dual theory which is just as good. The answer is that, for any function of the sphere such as a random number, a holographic dual theory cannot be constructed. In other words, there is no dual theory which does not have a random number function of the sphere.

## What is the formula for general relativity?

What is the formula for general relativity? The formula for general relativity is the metric tensor, which is defined as: = t + R 2 , where R is the distance between two points on a sphere, and the metric tensor is the matrix which defines the gravitational field.

## What are the five postulates of general relativity?

The five postulates of general relativity are as follows:

1. The universe is spacetime.
2. The spacetime is curved.
3. The curvature of spacetime is caused by the presence of matter.
4. The gravitational force is a result of the curvature of spacetime.
5. The gravitational force is independent of the mass of the object being acted upon.

## How many dimensions are there in general relativity?

There are an infinite number of dimensions in general relativity. In order to understand this, we must first understand the concept of time. Time is a dimensionless quantity. This means that there is no such thing as a time interval.

## Is general relativity deterministic?

General relativity is deterministic, but it is not necessarily causal. In fact, it is possible to construct a theory of relativity that is not causal.

## Is general relativity Einsteinian?

No, general relativity is not Einsteinian. It is based on the principle of equivalence, which states that all objects of the same mass and same gravitational field experience the same grav

Explain the theory of general relativity. What kind of phenomena can we observe due to it? What is the physical role of gravity in the universe?

## Introduction

Albert Einstein (1879–1955) is one of the most famous physicists and mathematicians of our time. He made revolutionary proposals in different areas of physics. He is well known for the so-called relativity theory. Beside Einstein’s many great achievements, this relativity theory is, perhaps, the most revolutionary and famous one.

Einstein was born in Germany and brought up in Switzerland. He was a poor student but loved to ask questions about the world, such as What is motion? That is, how do we know that we are moving, and what does it mean to be at rest?

Einstein’s most recognized work is the general theory of relativity. This theory of gravity is the geometric theory of gravity, which explains that the gravitational field is the geometry of space in a curved shape.

The theory of general relativity was first proposed in 1915. In 1960, one of the most famous astronomers in our time, Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar, wrote a book in which he discussed Einstein’s theory and its applications in science.

This paper presents a brief review of the special theory of relativity from the original work of Einstein, which is given in this great book.^{1} The main aim of this paper is to present two important consequences of this theory:

1. The relativity of simultaneity
2. The twin paradox

The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section “The Postulates of Special Relativity” presents the postulates of special relativity. Next, Section “The Lorentz Transformation” presents the Lorentz transformation. In Section “The Relativity of Simultaneity,” we discuss the relativity of simultaneity. The twin paradox is discussed in the section “The Twin Paradox”. Finally, the paper concludes with Section “Conclusion”.

## The Postulates of Special Relativity

The theory of relativity was first proposed by Albert Einstein in 1905. The theory is based on two postulates:

1. The principle of relativity
2. The principle of constancy of the velocity of light

The principle of relativity means that the laws of physics are the same for all observers who are in a state of uniform motion with respect to each other. In the words of Einstein “The same laws of electrodynamics and optics will be valid for all frames of reference for which the equations of mechanics hold good.”

The principle of constancy of the velocity of light means that the velocity of light in vacuum is the same for all observers, regardless of the motion of the light source.

A consequence of the second postulate is that time dilation occurs when light is observed from a moving reference frame. Einstein explained the classical form of time dilation formula: $\mathrm{\delta }t=\frac{{\mathrm{\delta }t}_{0}}{\mathrm{\sigma }}=\mathrm{\gamma }\mathrm{\delta }{t}_{0}(1+v/c)$

Where $\mathrm{\delta }t$ is the time interval measured by a clock in the moving reference frame, $\mathrm{\delta }{t}_{0}$ is the time interval measured by a clock at rest, γ is the Lorentz factor $\mathrm{\gamma }=1/\sqrt{1-{v}^{2}/{c}^{2}}$, c is the speed of light and v is the relative velocity of the moving frames of reference.

## Einstein's General Theory of Relativity

Einstein proposed that gravity is a consequence of the curvature of spacetime. He formulated a theory of gravitation that is more general than the theory of special relativity. Einstein's general theory of relativity is a geometric theory of gravity and a geometric theory of spacetime, which in combination provided a new understanding of the law of gravitation.дуюг the Einstein field equations, which are a system of ten partial differential equations that relate the curvature of spacetime to the energy and momentum within spacetime.

## The Equivalence Principle and Geodesics

The equivalence principle is a statement that local tests of gravitation cannot distinguish between the relative acceleration due to a non-inertial frame of reference or an external force due to gravity. The equivalence principle is a consequence of the principle of relativity, which states that the laws of physics are the same in all inertial frames of reference.дуюг inertial frame of reference is a frame of reference that an external observer would measure no acceleration relative to an inertial reference frame. The principle of equivalence states that in a region of spacetime where the laws of physics are the same as in an inertial frame of reference, the acceleration of a freely falling object in an otherwise empty region of spacetime is the same as the acceleration of an object in an inertial frame of reference.

Many believe that the world may have already reached peak oil, which means we are nearing the point where we have used up all the easily accessible oil reserves. While this may be true, there are still plenty of other forms of energy that can be tapped to help us continue to power our society. One of the most promising forms of renewable energy is solar power.

Solar power is the process of converting sunlight into electricity. It is a clean, sustainable, and renewable source of energy that can help us reduce our reliance on fossil fuels. Solar power can be used to generate electricity for homes, businesses, and even large-scale power plants.

There are several different types of solar power systems, each of which has its own advantages and disadvantages. The most common type of system is the photovoltaic (PV) system, which uses solar cells to convert sunlight into electricity. PV systems are suitable for small-scale applications, such as powering an individual home or business.

The other type of solar power system is the solar thermal system, which uses mirrors or lenses to concentrate sunlight onto a receiver, which is then used to heat a fluid. The heated fluid can then be used to generate electricity or to provide heat for a building. Solar thermal systems are

Explain the theory of general relativity.

- Gravitation is attractive in nature
- The gravitational force is proportional to the product of the masses of the two bodies and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between the centers of mass of the two bodies
- The direction of gravitational force between two bodies is along the line joining the centers of mass of the two bodies.
- The gravitational force exists only between the bodies having mass
- Gravitational force is different from electric force

The theory of gravitation proposed by Newton has following drawbacks

- It does not explain the fact that the motion of the planets around the sun is not stable.
- It does not explain the perihelion precession of Mercury and the anomalous motion of the moon.
- It does not explain the deflection of light at the sun’s neighborhood.
- It does not explain the structure of stars and the fact that they can support their own weight,

Observational data collected in the solar system

- Mercury, Venus, earth, Mars, Jupiter, Uranus, Neptune, and Saturn are the planets of the Solar System.
- The Sun is the source of light and heat for the planets.
- The solar system has a comet and an asteroid belt.
- The orbits of planets are nearly elliptic and lie in the plane of the solar equator.
- The orbits of planets lie on one side of the Sun.
- The aphelia and perihelia of planets revolve in the same direction.
- The speed of the planet in its orbit decreases as it moves away from the sun and increases as it comes nearer to the sun.
- Mercury, the planet closest to the Sun, has a retrograde motion.
- The mass of the planet is distributed in the form of spheroid.
- There are two major satellites of the earth: one is near the equator and other is near the poles.

Observational data collected from stars

- The stars are relatively very far away from the solar system.
- Diameter of a star is of the order of 105km, and the mass is of the order of 2 × 1030kg.
- The distance between two stars is of the order of many light years.
- The brightness of a star depends on its temperature.
- The brightness of a star is not always constant.
- The star moves along a curved path in space.
- The path of a star is the same as the path of the earth in its orbit.
- The velocity of the star is not constant. It decreases when the star comes near the earth and increases when it moves away from the earth.
- The stars sometimes throw out particles (meteorites) in space.
- The stars rotate about their own axis.
- The stars are not point-like.

Theory of relativity

It consisted of two parts, the special relativity and the general relativity.

Special relativity

The theory of special relativity is based on two postulates;

Postulate 1: The law of physics must be the same in all inertial frames of reference.

Postulate 2: The speed of light in vacuum is constant and its value in all inertial frames of reference is same.

Newton’s laws of motion failed to explain the phenomenon of optical aberration that is the change in the position of a star due to the motion of the earth. To explain this phenomenon, Einstein postulated the theory of special relativity. In this theory, he showed that the speed of light in vacuum remains constant for all inertial observers, even though these observers are in different frames of reference.

According to this theory, space and time are interchangeable, that is, time and space can be transformed into one another.

The following equations are used to calculate the coordinates and time in special relativity;

$\begin{equation*} x = \frac{X+vt}{\sqrt{1-\frac{v^{2}}{c^{2}}}} \end{equation*}$

$\begin{equation*} y = \frac{Y}{\sqrt{1-\frac{v^{2}}{c^{2}}}} \end{equation*}$

$\begin{equation*} z = \frac{Z}{\sqrt{1-\frac{v^{2}}{c^{2}}}} \end{equation*}$

$\begin{equation*} t = \frac{T+(\frac{v}{c^{2}})X + (\frac{v}{c^{2}})Y + (\frac{v}{c^{2}})Z}{\sqrt{1-\frac{v^{2}}{c^{2}}}} \end{equation*}$

where;

c = the speed of light (in vacuum)

x, y, z = the coordinates in the moving frame of reference

t = the time in the moving frame of reference

X, Y, Z = the coordinates in the stationary frame of reference

T = the time in the stationary frame of reference

v = the velocity of the frame of reference

Explain the theory of general relativity.

It is a theory proposed by Albert Einstein in 1915. According to theory, the first law of motion and the law of gravitation of Newton are no longer applicable. The deficiency of both the laws is overcome and unified by the theory. According to the theory, mass is the source of the curvature of space-time. It is a theory based on the field concept. It is an extension of special theory of relativity.

The basic equation of general theory of relativity is given as under:

$\large G_{\mu \nu} + \Lambda g_{\mu \nu} = 8 \pi G T_{\mu \nu}$

What is the relationship between Newtonian gravity and general theory of relativity?

Newton’s law of gravitation is obtained as a limiting law of general theory of relativity in empty space.

What is Weak Equivalence Principle and Strong Equivalence Principle?

Weak Equivalence Principle is a fundamental principle of general theory of relativity which states that the gravitational mass is same as inertial mass and both are proportional to energy as expressed by equation E = mc^{2}.

Strong Equivalence Principle is a generalization of Weak Equivalence Principle. It states that the gravitational mass of an object is equal to the inertial mass of the object. The acceleration of an object in a gravitational field is independent of the type of matter in the object. The acceleration of the object in the gravitational field depends only on the gravitational field and not on matter in the object.

Explain the meaning of Geodesic Deviation Equation.

Let us consider two neighboring freely falling test particles. Their relative position vector is ξ(s_{i}). Let g_{ij} be the metric tensor. Then

g_{ij,k} = 3^{rd} derivative;

g^{ij,k} = 3^{rd} derivative.

Their relative acceleration is then given by

What is a photon sphere?

A photon sphere is a region of space around a circle in the event horizon of a black hole where light rays move along one of the circular paths. At a radius of the black hole of 1.5 times the Schwarzschild radius, the photon sphere is formed. The shape of the sphere is very important in understanding the motion of light near the black hole. If light from an object at a slightly larger radius of the black hole is observed, then that light ray will be seen at a point that is closer to the black hole than the original object. This is known as the Einstein shift.

What is the Schwarzschild radius?

The Schwarzschild radius is the radial distance from the center of a non-rotating black hole in general relativity, beyond which an object cannot maintain its position but instead must fall inwards. The Schwarzschild radius of a body may be calculated by dividing the mass of the body by the gravitational constant. For a standard star with a mass of one solar mass, the Schwarzschild radius is about 3 kilometers.

What does the theory of general relativity explain?

The theory of general relativity is a mathematical theory proposed by Albert Einstein to describe gravity, which is the force by which objects attract each other. Gravity is the force that keeps the Earth in orbit around the Sun and the moon in orbit around the Earth.

Explain the theory of general relativity.

Einstein's special theory of relativity assumes that the speed of light in vacuum is a universal constant which is the same for all observers regardless of their motion or the velocity of the light-source. Special relativity makes it necessary to reject the concept of absolute time and space and allows the concept of spacetime as the universal background. Only in spacetime can distances and time intervals be defined. Also, a clock is defined as a physical process that permits us to compare time intervals and every clock is specific to a certain reference frame. Special relativity demonstrates that our experience of space and time is dependent on how fast we are going and which direction we are traveling.

Einstein's general theory of relativity allows us to study how gravity bends space and time. General relativity shows that gravity is no longer a force but instead a consequence of the bending of space and time by mass and energy. This bending, called curvature, occurs because space and time are dynamic components of spacetime. The curvature of spacetime means that spacetime is not a flat plain but has contours like a ball or saddle. The curvature of spacetime appears to gravity in the same way that the shape of a hill appears to a ball which rolls across the hill. General relativity predicts that objects will follow different paths through spacetime. According to Einstein, an object's path through spacetime is a geodesic, which can be compared to the shortest path or a direct line between two points on the surface of a ball. A geodesic is a straight line in flat spacetime while on the surface of a sphere it is a great circle.

General relativity is a theory of gravitation published by Albert Einstein in 1915. According to this theory, the observed gravitational attraction between masses results from the warping of space and time by those masses. Also, the curvature of spacetime is interpreted as a geometric property of the underlying space and time, and is not affected by the state of motion of an observer.

General relativity has been confirmed by most experiments. This theory has been important in the development of the standard model in particle physics, which is the current scientific explanation for the fundamental forces of nature and the elementary particles postulated to exist.

Einstein's field equation predicts that strong gravitational fields will compress space and time together. This has been observed in the orbital decay of binary stars. Merging binary stars have been observed to rotate faster in their orbits as they approach each other, consistent with such a model. It is also an important part of the current leading model for the formation of black holes.

The theory of general relativity has been tested in two important ways. First, the deflection of light in the gravitational field of the Sun was found to be in accord with the theory's predictions, confirming the influence of the fabric of spacetime. Second, the effect of gravitational time dilation on clocks in satellites was observed, confirming the stretching of time by strong gravitational fields.

Einstein's field equation predicts a number of new effects.

A rotating mass should bend space in a way that creates spacetime singularities. The effect is called frame dragging or gravitomagnetism, and is analogous to the dragging of inertial frames of reference by the Earth's rotation. It is, however a largely unobservable effect.

An observer inside a black hole would see space-time stretched vertically, and his time stretched horizontally, and ultimately be torn apart. This is often explained using a "ladder in a black hole" analogy.

However, a circular path can be followed that avoids the singularity. This path is called a geodesic, and is the kind of path followed by light rays and by orbiting bodies. It is the path that minimizes travelled distance, and so is a great circle.

If an observer were to pass close to a black hole, he would see spacetime stretched vertically in front of him, but stretched horizontally behind him (i.e., his time stretched horizontally, and his space stretched vertically). If he could withstand the forces, he could escape the black hole by swimming vertically in a direction parallel to the rotation of the black hole. In 2001, this effect was confirmed by the observations of a quasar (a distant galaxy with an extremely active nucleus) known as OJ 287. The result showed a periodic lensing effect, as a second image of the quasar, which is caused by the black hole in the nucleus of the galaxy.

A black hole will eventually lose its angular momentum, and will therefore settle into a static shape that is a direct analogy to a Reissner-Nordstrom black hole. In the last stages, the black hole will radiate gravitational waves that are strong enough to escape the black hole.

Einstein's original formulation of general relativity was in the form of a differential equation governing the behavior of the gravitational field. This form is equivalent to a variational principle called the Einstein-Hilbert action, which is the action functional for general relativity. The Einstein-Hilbert action proposed by Einstein and Hilbert in 1915 is a path integral over all possible spacetimes.

Both formulations are equivalent, but the equivalence is not obvious. The differential equation of general relativity is usually written in terms of his field equation, but this does not make it obvious that the field equation arises from a variational principle.

The field equation is one of the simplest possible equations that is consistent with the symmetries of the underlying spacetime. However, Einstein's original field equation does not arise from a variational principle that uses a symmetric metric. The field equation can be derived from a variational principle using a non-symmetric metric, but this non-symmetric metric was later shown to be equivalent to the symmetric metric found by Einstein in 1915.

The non-symmetric metric found by Einstein is now known as the Einstein-Rosen metric. This metric is not symmetric in conventional space-time, but is symmetric in a more general spacetime that combines space and time into a single mathematical structure. The metric is symmetric in this more general spacetime because it is a tensor, but it is not symmetric in

Explain the theory of general relativity. What kind of phenomena can be predicted using the theory of general relativity?

The theory of relativity was the most important and revolutionary development in physics since Newton's theory of gravitation. Einstein's theory of general relativity describes gravity as a phenomenon which forms a geometric relation between space and time. According to general relativity, space-time is a four-dimensional continuum, to which a point in space is given by three coordinates, while the time is given by the fourth coordinate. However, this four dimensional continuum is not flat like the surface of a table. It is curved, and this curvature is the source of gravitational fields, as space-time is pulled inwards by the presence of masses.

Phenomena which can be predicted by general relativity are: 1) The bending of light rays by massive objects like the sun. 2) The precession of the orbit of planets. 3) Gravitational time dilation. 4) Gravitational waves.

Explain the theory of special relativity. What kind of phenomena can be predicted using the theory of special relativity?

The theory of special relativity was the most important and revolutionary development in physics since Isaac Newton's theory of gravitation. Special relativity is a mathematical formula, which explains how distance and time are perceived differently by observers in different frames of reference. Special relativity states that the speed of light is the same for all observers. However, this speed is not constant. It is determined by the frame of reference of the observer, and this is why it seems that the speed of light is different for different observers.

Phenomena which can be predicted by special relativity are: 1) The phenomena observed in particle colliders, such as the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). 2) The phenomena observed in the collision of neutrinos with the Earth.

Explain how a laser beam could be used to measure a distance of 2 meters.

Laser beam could be used to measure a distance of 2 meters by measuring the time it takes for the laser beam to travel that distance. The speed of the laser beam is the speed of light, which is 300,000 km/sec. So, in 1 sec, the laser beam will travel 300,000 km. In 2 sec, the laser beam will travel 600,000 km.

If the laser beam takes 2 sec to travel 2 meters, then the distance is 2 meters.

Explain the following terms that are used in the study of relativity: spacetime, coordinate system, four-vector, scalar, vector, velocity, acceleration, space-time interval, gravitational redshift, Hubble's constant, Big Bang.

A spacetime is a four-dimensional space, which is made up of three spatial dimensions plus one time dimension. A coordinate system is a set of coordinates, which are used to describe the position of a point in space, or space-time. A four-vector is a vector, which has four components. A scalar is a number, which has only one component. A vector is a number, which has two components. Velocity is the rate of change of position with respect to time. Acceleration is the rate of change of velocity with respect to time. Space-time interval is the distance between two points in space-time. Gravitational redshift is the phenomenon, when a light ray is observed to have a longer wavelength than it had before it was emitted. Hubble's constant is the rate at which the universe is expanding. Big Bang is the theory, according to which the universe originated from a single point, which was very hot and dense.

Explain the terms: time dilation, space dilation, proper acceleration.

Time dilation is a phenomenon that occurs in the theory of relativity, where the time interval in one frame of reference is greater than the time interval in another frame of reference. Space dilation is a phenomenon that occurs in the theory of relativity, where the space interval in one frame of reference is greater than the space interval in another frame of reference. Proper acceleration is the acceleration of an object on its proper axis.

Explain the terms: redshift, blue shift, gravitational redshift, time dilation.

Redshift is a phenomenon where the wavelength of light is increased. Blue shift is a phenomenon where the wavelength of light is decreased. Gravitational redshift is the phenomenon where light emitted from a source above the surface of the Earth is observed to have a longer wavelength than the light emitted from the same source below the surface of the Earth. Time dilation is the phenomenon where the time interval of an event in one frame of reference is greater than the time interval of the same event in another frame of reference.

In my post on Special relativity, I’ve explained the theory of special relativity as well as its real-world implications. As an introduction into the topic of general relativity, I’ve explained the basics of gravity and the equivalence principle. In this post, I will explain the theory of general relativity.

## Introduction

The theory of special relativity explains that spacetime is a continuum where time and space are interconnected. The theory states that the speed of light is constant in space. Thus, time slows down and distances contract when observed from a frame of reference that is moving relative to the observer.

One difficulty with the theory of special relativity is that, according to its postulates, the laws of physics remain the same in all frames of reference. This means, for example, that an observer cannot distinguish between gravitational field and acceleration. From the point of view of an astronaut, free-fall is experienced as weightlessness.

The theory does not explain why objects fall to the ground. And it does not explain why objects without mass can exert a gravitational effect on other objects.

Newton’s theory of gravity explained the attraction of the earth towards objects and its application had given us a lot of accurate results. However, the theory of gravity has never explained why gravity exists.

It was Albert Einstein who published his general theory of relativity in 1916, in which he explained the nature of gravity as a consequence of the curvature of spacetime. The theory was based on the concepts of special relativity and the laws of physics, as Einstein suggested.

## General relativity

In this theory, gravity can be explained in terms of the bending of spacetime. As described in the equivalence principle, there is no way for a free-falling observer to tell if he is falling in a gravitational field or if he is in an inertial frame of reference accelerating in a straight line. Because of this, Einstein reasoned that the presence of a gravitational field is equivalent to the existence of a curved spacetime.

General relativity is a theory of gravitation that was published by Albert Einstein in 1915. The theory states that gravity is a warping of spacetime, as described by the curvature of the spacetime. This theory asserts that the presence of a gravitational field is equivalent to the existence of a curved spacetime.

Einstein’s two postulates:

Einstein’s two postulates are:

1. Spacetime is a continuum where time and space are interconnected.
2. The laws of physics remain the same in all frames of reference, in conformity with the principle of relativity.

### Theory of general relativity

The theory of general relativity in general describes the curvature of spacetime by the presence of matter and energy. In regions where the matter or energy density is low, spacetime is flat, represented by a Minkowski space. In regions where there is a high density of matter, spacetime is strongly curved.

In the presence of a gravitational field, the theory predicts that clocks run more slowly and that space appears to contract when observed from a frame of reference that is moving relative to the observer.

Einstein’s theory predicts that the gravitational field is a direct consequence of the curvature of spacetime. The bending of a beam of light by the sun is the simplest example of this. The bending of light is explained by the presence of a strong gravitational field near the sun, which causes the light to be bent toward the center of the sun.

The theory also predicts that objects in free-fall accelerate toward the center of the sun, and that light is redshifted when traveling toward the sun.

### Testing general relativity

The theory of general relativity has been tested in a variety of ways, including the bending of light by the sun, the redshift of light from distant galaxies, and the gravitational redshift of light from the sun. The theory has also been tested in laboratory experiments, such as the Pound-Rebka experiment and the Gravity Probe A experiment.

In the Pound-Rebka experiment, the researchers measured the frequency of light emitted by a cesium atom in the gravitational field of the earth. They found that the frequency of the light was lower than the frequency of the light emitted by the same atom in a laboratory on the surface of the earth. This result was consistent with the predictions of general relativity.

In the Gravity Probe A experiment, the researchers measured the precession of gyroscopes in the gravitational field of the earth. They found that the precession of the gyroscopes was consistent with the predictions of general relativity.

The theory of general relativity has also been tested in observations of the cosmic microwave background radiation. The theory predicts that the radiation should be polarized in a certain way, and the observations have confirmed this prediction.

### General relativity and cosmology

The theory of general relativity has been used to explain many of the observations in cosmology. For example, the theory predicts that the universe is expanding and that the expansion is accelerating. The theory also predicts that the universe has a very low density of matter, which is consistent with the observations of the cosmic microwave background radiation.

The theory of general relativity has also been used to explain the formation of structures in the universe, such as galaxies and galaxy clusters. The theory predicts that the matter in the universe will cluster together to form structures, and the observations of the cosmic microwave background radiation have confirmed this prediction.

## Schwarzschild metric

The Schwarzschild metric is a mathematical description of the curvature of spacetime near a spherical object, such as a star or a black hole. The metric was first derived by Karl Schwarzschild in 1916, and it is one of the simplest and most important solutions to Einstein’s field equations.

The metric describes the curvature of spacetime in the vicinity of a spherical object, such as a star or a black hole. The metric is given by the following equation:

dS2 = – dt2 + dR2 + R2dΩ2

where dS is the infinitesimal distance between two points, dt is the infinitesimal time interval, dR is the infinitesimal radial coordinate, and dΩ is the infinitesimal solid angle.

The metric describes the curvature of spacetime in the vicinity of a spherical object. In the Schwarzschild metric, the time coordinate t is a function of the radial coordinate R, and the radial coordinate R is a function of the time coordinate t. The metric is axisymmetric, which means that it is invariant under rotations about the z-axis.

The Schwarzschild metric can be used to calculate the properties of a black hole, such as its mass, radius, and spin. The metric can also be used to calculate the deflection of light by a black hole, and the gravitational redshift of light from a black hole.

## Event horizon and singularities

The event horizon is the boundary of a black hole. It is the point of no return, beyond which nothing can escape the gravitational pull of the black hole. The event horizon is defined by the Schwarzschild radius, which is given by the following equation:

r = 2GM/c2

where G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass of the black hole, and c is the speed of light.

The Schwarzschild radius is the same as the event horizon for a non-rotating, non-charged black hole. However, for a rotating black hole or a black hole with an electric charge, the event horizon is shifted outward from the Schwarzschild radius.

The singularity is the point in spacetime where the curvature of spacetime is infinite. The singularity is the point at which the Schwarzschild metric breaks down. The singularity is also known as the “point of no return” because once a black hole has reached the singularity, it can never escape.

The singularity is the point at which the curvature of spacetime is infinite. This point is also known as the “point of no return” because once a black hole has reached the singularity, it can never escape. The singularity is also believed to be the point at which the laws of physics break down and become incomplete.

The singularity is not observable because it is hidden behind the event horizon. However, the area near the singularity is known as the “ergosphere”. The ergosphere is the point at which the curvature of spacetime is so strong that the laws of physics break down.

Explain the theory of general relativity.

It is a theory proposed by Albert Einstein in 1915. According to theory, the first law of motion and the law of gravitation of Newton are no longer applicable. The deficiency of both the laws is overcome and unified by the theory. The theory deals with gravity as the result of curving of time and space so that both come under a single mathematical treatment. Gravity affects the behaviour and path of light.

Explain the curvature of space and time.

If the Earth is considered as a sphere, so the light ray passing through the Earth will be deflected. If we consider this as the motion of the planet Earth, we can say that the planet Earth is bending under the gravity of the Sun. In the same way, according to the theory of general relativity, the space-time around the planet Earth is getting bent under the influence of gravity. This is called curvature of space-time. It may be noted that this curvature is not appreciable near the Earth. This bending is appreciable near the Sun and the stars.

What is the curvature of space-time?

Any object is curved. A curved object is one whose shape is not straight but bent. A piece of paper can be bent. A curved object gives the illusion of two different directions. The curved object makes it difficult to decide which of the two directions is the straight one. In a curved space, the light beam will follow a trajectory in opposite directions.

Explain the relation between acceleration and gravity.

Acceleration is produced in a body by the application of a force. Any force applied to a body produces an acceleration. It may be noted that the force applied to a body can be due to gravity. Gravity is a force. Thus, gravity too can produce acceleration in a body. According to the theory of general relativity, gravity and acceleration are equivalent.

What is the difference between gravitational and inertial mass?

The physical property of a body, due to which it is attracted by the gravitational force, is called its gravitational mass. The physical property of a body, due to which it produces the gravitational force, is called its inertial mass.

Explain the gravitation.

An object attracts a different object. This attraction is called gravitation. It may be noted that gravitation is a force. It is a force which acts between two bodies. The magnitude of gravitation depends upon the masses of the two bodies and the distance between them.

What is the free fall?

A body that falls freely under the gravity of the Earth is called free fall. It may be noted that free fall is the motion of the body under the influence of gravity alone. The motion of a body near the Earth's surface is considered as a free fall.

What is the importance of gravitation?

All the planets, including the Earth, are held in their place by the gravitational attraction of the Sun. We cannot walk on the surface of the Earth without the gravitational force. All the stars and galaxies are held together by the gravitational force.

What is the similarity between gravitation and electromagnetic force?

Gravitation and electromagnetic force are similar in the following points:

(a) Both are action-at-a-distance forces.

(b) Both have long range.

(c) Both are non-contact forces.

Tell us about the Newton's law of gravitation.

Newton's law of gravitation states that, "Every body attracts every other body with a force that is directly proportional to the product of the masses of both the bodies and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them."

What are the shortcomings of Newton's law of gravitation?

The shortcomings of the Newton's law of gravitation are:

(a) It does not explain the motion of the planet Mercury.

(b) It does not explain the deflection of light by the gravitational field.

(c) It is not applicable to the motion of the stars.

What is the difference between the Newtonian mechanics and theory of general relativity?

Newtonian mechanics and theory of general relativity have the following differences:

(a) Newtonian mechanics applies only to the motion of the planets. The theory of general relativity applies to all the motion of the bodies.

(b) In Newtonian mechanics, the gravitational force is a universal gravitational force. In general relativity, the gravitational force is considered to be different for different bodies.

(c) In Newtonian mechanics, there is no acceleration due to gravity. In the theory of general relativity, acceleration is produced by the force of gravity.

What is the radius of curvature of the space-time around the Sun?

The radius of curvature of the space-time around the Sun is 1.5 × 10^{11} m.

What is the mass of the Sun?

The mass of the Sun is 2 × 10^{30} kg.

What is the radius of curvature of the space-time around the planet Earth?

The radius of curvature of the space-time around the planet Earth is 8.9 × 10^{6} m.

What is the mass of the planet Earth?

The mass of the planet Earth is 6 × 10^{24} kg.

What is the difference between gravitational and inertial mass?

The physical property of a body, due to which it is attracted by the gravitational force, is called its gravitational mass. The physical property of a body, due to which it produces the gravitational force, is called its inertial mass.

Give the relation between gravitational and inertial mass.

The ratio of the gravitational mass of a body to its inertial mass is the same for all the bodies. This ratio is called the constant of gravitation. The mathematical expression of the same is:

G = G_{0}

Where, G_{0} is the constant of gravitation.

What is the free fall?

A body that falls freely under the gravity of the Earth is called free fall. It may be noted that free fall is the motion of the body under the influence of gravity alone. The motion of a body near the Earth's surface is considered as a free fall.

G = G_{0} = 6.67 × 10^{-11} m^{3} kg^{-1} s^{-2}

rating expansion of the universe. The second order effect of this cosmological constant is the effect of gravity in the general theory of relativity. Historically, the gravitational force was one of the first effects to be explained in general relativity. Indeed, the bending of light passing near a massive body (as in an eclipse of the sun) was an early observation that supported Einstein's theory. We consider the geometric interpretation of the gravitational field given in this theory, as well as the precession of planetary orbits due to gravity. (You may refer to the figure for the two-sphere example).

25. In General Relativity, the curvature of spacetime is determined by the distribution of matter throughout the universe. Assume a spherical shell of matter of radius $R_s$ and total mass $M$. This matter is distributed homogeneously throughout the sphere, and there is no matter outside of the sphere. Show that for $R_s >> R_o$, where $R_o$ is the radius of the event horizon and $R_s >> 2M$, one has $R_o = 1.5M$.

## 1 Answer to Exercise 7.3

General relativity theory of Einstein is based on the following three postulates.

1. The velocity of light is the same in all frames of reference.
2. Space is not absolute.
3. Matter curves space.

### 1 The velocity of light is the same in all frames of reference

In 1905 Albert Einstein stated that the velocity of light should be the same in all frames of reference. In the years 1500-2000, scientists believed that the speed of light was dependent on the position and motion of the observer. When, for example, moving along a highway past an observer, the light from a headlight of an approaching car has a higher velocity than that of a receding one. The speed of light was considered the same as the motion of sound when both media had the same temperature. The speed of light in air is as fast as the speed of light in a vacuum. The velocity of light in a material medium is proportional to the square root of its reciprocal refractive index. The speed of light is unbounded. This also contains the unbounded velocity of the superluminal velocity of light. It also contains the unbounded velocity of superluminal velocity.

It contains the unbounded velocity of superluminal velocity. It also contains the unbounded velocity of superluminal velocity.

It also contains the unbounded velocity of superluminal velocity. It also contains the unbounded velocity of superluminal velocity.

It also contains the unbounded velocity of superluminal velocity.-

## Introductory Unit

"We begin with an introduction to the theory of relativity. In the second and third units we are going to build the mathematical apparatus that we will need in order to apply the theory to the motion of celestial bodies.
## What is General Relativity

In this next lecture we are going to discuss the theory of General Relativity which is just a new theory of gravitation. And it is the theory of gravitation that we are going to need in order to use it to analyse the motion of celestial bodies. But I have to say that it is not just a new theory of gravitation, because there is a lot of things that is predicted by Newton's theory of gravitation. But it is much more than Newton's theory.

It is a new understanding of spacetime. And we call this new theory the general theory of relativity. Why do we talk about relativity? This is because there is a very strong relationship between Newton's theory and Einstein's theory. In fact, we have here the name of Newton and the name of Einstein. And this is the first expression of the general theory of relativity. But what is the difference between Newton's theory and Einstein's theory? Newton's theory is a local theory. This means that in this theory, the quantity of gravity depends only from the mass. But there are other influences. In the general theory of relativity, the quantity of gravity depends from the mass and from the curvature of the space-time. In the first theory, the curvature is constant. In the general theory it is variable and depends on the quantity of matter.­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­

Explain the theory of general relativity. What kind of phenomena can we observe if the theory of general relativity is true?

Since the general theory of relativity and the special theory of relativity are so closely related and so many ideas and concepts are common to both of them, a detailed discussion of the former is not required. Suffice it to say that the general theory of relativity is an extension of the special relativity to accelerated reference frame. In the general theory, the relativity of length and time are generalized by including acceleration as a dynamical variable leading to the gravitational field. In the special theory of relativity, gravity is associated to its effect on the inertial frame and not as a dynamical variable.

What does it mean to say that the equation of motion \(m a = F\) has a fundamental scale. It has no fundamental scale in the sense of a length scale or mass scale. If it has a fundamental scale at all, it must be a velocity scale. And indeed, what is that scale?.

Intuitively, it is the speed of light, but because of the presence of two different kinds of dimensions in the equation of motion and its generalization, the field equations, the fundamental scale is really a dimensionless ratio. This ratio is given by the value of a vector called the Weyl vector.

The Weyl vector is associated to a timelike vector called the energy-momentum vector which is the source of the gravitational field. The Weyl vector is the ratio of the norm to the length of the energy-momentum vector. In the case of a single particle, the energy-momentum vector is given by the difference between the total and rest mass energies of the particle. The norm of this vector is twice the total energy of the particle. The length is given by the mass times the speed of light squared. The energy in the particle's rest frame is given by the product of its rest mass and the square of the speed of light. The relativistic mass increase of a particle moving with a speed \( v \) with respect to its rest frame is given by\( \) $$ m_0=\frac{m}{\sqrt{1-v^2}} $$ where \( m_0 \) is the rest mass, \( m \) is the relativistic mass, and \( v \) is the velocity of the object of mass \( m \).лизцезц

In General Relativity, gravitation is an aspect of the geometry of space-time itself. The gravitational field strength at a point is calculated directly from the geometry of the space-time at that point, and from the inertial momentum at that point, rather than being a field created by matter. This fundamental difference between GR and the Newtonian description is described through the geodesic property of GR. In GR, a body moves in a straight line, and the line is the closest distance (shortest distance) between two points that can be imagined by the observer.

The shortest distance is called geodesic. In General Relativity the line that is the geodesic is called the time-like line, although it is not in fact the time. It is the light-like line is the time-lkin Relativity theory. It is in General Relativity, the curve of the space-time the space-time curve is not a line. But space-time curve, when it is represented in a figure, the curve is shown as a line. The space-time curve is the part of a cone whose axis coincides with the axis of the space-time coordinates. When one measures the length along the space-time axis, the length of the distance between two different points along the axis depends on the time at which the distance is measured and is longer the later that measurement is made. The cone is the surface generated by the intersection of the space-time axis with the surfaces of

Two surfaces are concentric if and only if one is the reflection of the other through the origin. A curve is spherical if it is the intersection of the interior of two concentric spheres.

A sphere is the intersection of a plane and a sphere.

A cone is the set of points on a line through the origin.

A point in n-space is on a plane if and only if it is the intersection of n-1 planes. In two dimension the line through the origin is a line, and the line through the origin is a cone, and planes are the triangles through the origin.

As to the points on the triangle, I think that by this you mean that it is like a point, an infinitesimal. Like a dot. If we write it down we can use a small letter, but that’s just an abbreviation, a way of writing it down. The point itself is invisible. It is a kind of ideal or infinitesimal object. On the other hand, it is essential to our mathematics and abstract mathematics and to our physics.

By a point, we mean an infinitesimal object, and that is why the point is essential to physics. In physics, time and space are made of point after point: a

### Your Answer

Surround your text in *italics* or **bold**, to write a math equation use, for example, $x^2+2x+1=0$ or $$\beta^2-1=0$$ййй $$e^{i\pi } + 1 = 0$$

\[\beta^2-1=0\]

\[\beta^2-1=0\]

\[\beta^2-1=0\]

\[\beta^2-1=0\]

\[e^{i\pi } + 1 = 0\]

\[e^{i\pi } + 1 = 0\]

\[e^{i\pi } + 1 = 0\]

\[e^{i\pi } + 1 = 0\]

\[\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \frac{\sin(x)}{x}dx = \pi\]

\[\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \frac{\sin(x)}{x}dx = \pi\]

\[\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \frac{\sin(x)}{x}dx = \pi\]

\[\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \frac{\sin(x)}{x}dx = \pi\]

\[\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \frac{\sin(x)}{x}dx = \pi\]

\[\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \frac{\sin(x)}{x}dx = \pi\]

\[\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \frac{\sin(x)}{x}dx = \pi\]

\[\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \frac{\sin(x)}{x}dx = \pi\]

\[\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \frac{\sin(x)}{x}dx = \pi\]

When he was 25 years old, Einstein had the original idea of general relativity.

- Physicists were previously considering the gravitation as a kind of force.
- But Einstein realised: This is not right.
- It is a matter of a space-time geometry.
- The gravitational field is caused by the fact, that objects can bend space-time.
- This gives rise to geodesics - to curves of movement in space-time.
- These geodesics bend because of the curvature of space-time.
- We can compute the differential equations of the geodesics.
- These differential equations have a solution.
- The solution are the geodesics.
- In general relativity, the geodesics are taken to be the orbits of particles.
- In general relativity, the geodesics are taken to be the light rays.
- In general relativity, the universe itself is described by a geodesic.

## The Static Universe

Suppose that the Universe obeys the theory of general relativity. The theory of general relativity applies to any observers, regardless of the speed of the observers. So, it applies to a static observer. If we want to generalize to the case of a moving observer, we will get the theory of special relativity, which is not relevant to the present discussion. So, we are interested in a static observer. Note that, for a static observer, we cannot distinguish between the space and the time, because the static state is invariant under the global translations. So, if we denote the space by $S$ and the time by $T$, we have $T\cong S$. So, a spacetime under the static observer is a four-torus $\mathbb{T}^4$. Recall that the four-torus is the group manifold of $\mathbb{R}^4$ under the Heisenberg group.

Hence by the theorem of Lie, we have a chart $(q,t,\lambda,\mu)$ $(q,t\in \mathbb{R}^2,\lambda,\mu\in \mathbb{T}^2)$. Then the metric is given by

$\langle \frac{\partial}{\partial q},\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\rangle=0,\langle \frac{\partial}{\partial q},\frac{\partial}{\partial \lambda}\rangle=\langle \frac{\partial}{\partial q},\frac{\partial}{\partial \mu}\rangle=1,\langle \frac{\partial}{\partial t},\frac{\partial}{\partial \lambda}\rangle=\langle \frac{\partial}{\partial t},\frac{\partial}{\partial \mu}\rangle=0.\)

It is a theory proposed by Albert Einstein in 1917. According to theory Gravity is the curving of space time by mass. As the mass increases the curvature of space time increases.

What is the difference between gravity and acceleration?

Acceleration is the effect of the gravity. The gravity is the attractive force between the objects.

Do all massive bodies attract each other?

All massive bodies attract the other bodies with the attractive force.

If you fall from an aircraft, is it because the earth is accelerating up or you are accelerating down?

The earth attracts you downwards and you are accelerating towards the ground.

When you throw a ball upwards, it comes down because of gravity. Why doesn’t it keep going up?

You gave the ball an initial upward push but the Earth’s gravity is greater than the force you gave it. It may seem as though it’s going up, but actually it’s accelerating upward at a rate of 9.8 m s^{−2} and the Earth is rotating at a comparable rate and it feels as though it’s going upwards.

You might think that Einstein’s theory of general relativity would imply that the universe is either expanding or contracting. But General Relativity does not predict whether the universe is expanding or contracting. It is possible to get very different futures. The Big Bang model might not be the right one and it is quite possible that the universe might end up collapsing back in on itself in future. Is that a problem? No, because the universe will go on expanding forever, and if it does it will go on expanding forever and we will all be dead.

I’m really not sure. I’m not sure, I’m not sure if it’s going to work. As it is, it’s just the way it is. But the thing about the Earth is that it’s constantly moving, so I don’t know how to stop it. If you want me to take a picture of my house, you have to go to the planetarium, you have to find out where it is. And when you find it, you have to go there.

## 5 star hotel in patong phuket, patong hotel and resort reviews

The city is very busy and crowded with visitors from all over Thailand and people from all over the world. If you want to stay in a budget guesthouse, you will find many of them along the beach road. For a mid range option you can stay in a number of hotels and smaller resorts. You can find some more information in travel guides or on the internet. If you are looking for a luxury resort, there are many of those as well.

Most hotels will arrange transportation from the airport (Songkran Beach Airport). If you are staying in Ao Nang or Krabi town, you can also take a local bus from the airport. You can also take a bus from town to the airport.

You can either do that yourself or use the hotel’s booking service.

All hotels in Krabi Town have air-conditioning, there isn’t a lot of good hotels in Ao Nang and Railay that have air-conditioning.

The best way is to stay in Krabi Town and than take a taxi to the beach.

It is a very popular activity in Krabi:

There are a lot of companies that organize island tours.

Yes.

There are 2 major motorcycle rental businesses in town, which have a stock of Chinese motorcycles for hire.

There is a big gap between the price of staying at a proper hotel and the nightly price of renting a room at a karaoke bar. At a hotel, expect to pay RMB 600 for a queen-size double, although it might be a little less; at the karaoke bar, though, you will be looking at RMB 30 or 40 (the more expensive ones will have bedrooms on the fourth or fifth floor) and there is usually a free breakfast in the bar, too. The bar can also double up as a nightclub or a restaurant. It is worth remembering that Kunming is not Hong Kong and you may not be able to have your breakfast at dawn, so make sure that it is stated on the card what time it is on offer and then make your arrangements accordingly.

Once dinner is over, guests can dance and/or watch the floor show until midnight or later. In the morning, the guests can return to pick up their hotel keys, give their gifts, and say goodbye to friends and/or their hosts. Of course, there are as many other variations as there are ethnic dinners: Some people invite guests at various times of the day and night. Even the gifts brought by guests vary. Some people are given a gift when they arrive, while others are given the gift when they leave. Some people bring a gift that is opened when they receive it while others bring a gift that is opened when the guest leaves. The only constant in the explanation of general relativity is that relativity is always explained. General relativity is a theory in physics that was developed by Albert Einstein between 1907 and 1915. Relativity is the theory that explains how the curvature of space-time (curvature of spacetime) affects matter. Relativity is the relativity of the curvature of spacetime.

## General Relativity (Theory)

The theory of general relativity was originally proposed by the great physicist Albert Einstein, in 1915, and holds that space and time are part of a single, coordinated skein called spacetime. Reality is seen as an energy field that curves spacetime, and this curvature is the force of gravity. Other mass distorts the fabric of spacetime, thereby bending this force. General relativity is not compatible with quantum mechanics, nor are there any systems to help the problem.

The equation of general relativity can be written

\[ \frac{1}{r^2} + \frac{1}r\partial_r + \frac{1}{2}g^{\mu\nu}(\partial_\mu \partial_\nu -\Gamma^\lambda_{\mu\nu}\partial_\lambda) + m = 0 \]
[3]

In this assignment we consider the simple case of a free particle of mass $m$ in 1 + 1 dimensions, and we will seek a solution of the form

$x(t) = et$ $p(t) = mv(t)$
[4]

where $e$ is the position eigenfunction with eigenvalue $p$, and $p(t)$ is the momentum eigenfunction with eigenvalue $m$. Substituting this into the kinetic term, we get

$(\frac{1}{2}e^2 \nabla^2 e + \frac{1}{2}p^2) + \frac{G}{r}$.

Now, the first term is clearly positive, but can the second term can be? It seems to be unclear to me. If it were negative, that would mean that there was a lower limit to the value of r, but I can't find that limit. Also, if the second term is negative, what does it imply about the curvature of spacetime?м

Edit - I meant to ask in which case would the second term be negative?

Explain the theory of general relativity.

Einstein's special theory of relativity assumes that the speed of light in vacuum is a universal constant which is the same for all observers regardless of their motion or the velocity of the light-source. Special relativity makes it necessary to reject the concept of absolute time and space and allows the concept of spacetime as the universal background. Only in spacetime can distances and time intervals be defined. Also, a clock is defined as a physical process that permits us to compare time intervals and every clock is specific to a certain reference frame. Special relativity demonstrates that our experience of space and time is dependent on how fast we are going and which direction we are traveling.

Einstein's general theory of relativity allows us to study how gravity bends space and time. General relativity shows that gravity is no longer a force but instead a consequence of the bending of space and time by mass and energy. This bending, called curvature, occurs because space and time are dynamic components of spacetime. The curvature of spacetime means that spacetime is not a flat plain but has contours like a ball or saddle. The curvature of spacetime appears to gravity in the same way that the shape of a hill appears to a ball which rolls across the hill. General relativity predicts that objects will follow different paths through spacetime. According to Einstein, an object's path through spacetime is a geodesic, which can be compared to the shortest path or a direct line between two points on the surface of a ball. A geodesic is a straight line in flat spacetime while on the surface of a sphere it is a great circle.

General relativity is a theory of gravitation published by Albert Einstein in 1915. According to this theory, the observed gravitational attraction between masses results from the warping of space and time by those masses. Also, the curvature of spacetime is interpreted as a geometric property of the underlying space and time, and is not affected by the state of motion of an observer.

General relativity has been confirmed by most experiments. This theory has been important in the development of the standard model in particle physics, which is the current scientific explanation for the fundamental forces of nature and the elementary particles postulated to exist.

Einstein's field equation predicts that strong gravitational fields will compress space and time together. This has been observed in the orbital decay of binary stars. Merging binary stars have been observed to rotate faster in their orbits as they approach each other, consistent with such a model. It is also an important part of the current leading model for the formation of black holes.

The theory of general relativity has been tested in two important ways. First, the deflection of light in the gravitational field of the Sun was found to be in accord with the theory's predictions, confirming the influence of the fabric of spacetime. Second, the effect of gravitational time dilation on clocks in satellites was observed, confirming the stretching of time by strong gravitational fields.

Einstein's field equation predicts a number of new effects.

A rotating mass should bend space in a way that creates spacetime singularities. The effect is called frame dragging or gravitomagnetism, and is analogous to the dragging of inertial frames of reference by the Earth's rotation. It is, however a largely unobservable effect.

An observer inside a black hole would see space-time stretched vertically, and his time stretched horizontally, and ultimately be torn apart. This is often explained using a "ladder in a black hole" analogy.

However, a circular path can be followed that avoids the singularity. This path is called a geodesic, and is the kind of path followed by light rays and by orbiting bodies. It is the path that minimizes travelled distance, and so is a great circle.

If an observer were to pass close to a black hole, he would see spacetime stretched vertically in front of him, but stretched horizontally behind him (i.e., his time stretched horizontally, and his space stretched vertically). If he could withstand the forces, he could escape the black hole by swimming vertically in a direction parallel to the rotation of the black hole. In 2001, this effect was confirmed by the observations of a quasar (a distant galaxy with an extremely active nucleus) known as OJ 287. The result showed a periodic lensing effect, as a second image of the quasar, which is caused by the black hole in the nucleus of the galaxy.

A black hole will eventually lose its angular momentum, and will therefore settle into a static shape that is a direct analogy to a Reissner-Nordstrom black hole. In the last stages, the black hole will radiate gravitational waves that are strong enough to escape the black hole.

Einstein's original formulation of general relativity was in the form of a differential equation governing the behavior of the gravitational field. This form is equivalent to a variational principle called the Einstein-Hilbert action, which is the action functional for general relativity. The Einstein-Hilbert action proposed by Einstein and Hilbert in 1915 is a path integral over all possible spacetimes.

Both formulations are equivalent, but the equivalence is not obvious. The differential equation of general relativity is usually written in terms of his field equation, but this does not make it obvious that the field equation arises from a variational principle.

The field equation is one of the simplest possible equations that is consistent with the symmetries of the underlying spacetime. However, Einstein's original field equation does not arise from a variational principle that uses a symmetric metric. The field equation can be derived from a variational principle using a non-symmetric metric, but this non-symmetric metric was later shown to be equivalent to the symmetric metric found by Einstein in 1915.

The non-symmetric metric found by Einstein is now known as the Einstein-Rosen metric. This metric is not symmetric in conventional space-time, but is symmetric in a more general spacetime that combines space and time into a single mathematical structure. The metric is symmetric in this more general spacetime because it is a tensor, but it is not symmetric in

Explain the theory of general relativity. What kind of phenomena can be predicted using the theory of general relativity?

The theory of relativity was the most important and revolutionary development in physics since Newton's theory of gravitation. Einstein's theory of general relativity describes gravity as a phenomenon which forms a geometric relation between space and time. According to general relativity, space-time is a four-dimensional continuum, to which a point in space is given by three coordinates, while the time is given by the fourth coordinate. However, this four dimensional continuum is not flat like the surface of a table. It is curved, and this curvature is the source of gravitational fields, as space-time is pulled inwards by the presence of masses.

Phenomena which can be predicted by general relativity are: 1) The bending of light rays by massive objects like the sun. 2) The precession of the orbit of planets. 3) Gravitational time dilation. 4) Gravitational waves.

Explain the theory of special relativity. What kind of phenomena can be predicted using the theory of special relativity?

The theory of special relativity was the most important and revolutionary development in physics since Isaac Newton's theory of gravitation. Special relativity is a mathematical formula, which explains how distance and time are perceived differently by observers in different frames of reference. Special relativity states that the speed of light is the same for all observers. However, this speed is not constant. It is determined by the frame of reference of the observer, and this is why it seems that the speed of light is different for different observers.

Phenomena which can be predicted by special relativity are: 1) The phenomena observed in particle colliders, such as the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). 2) The phenomena observed in the collision of neutrinos with the Earth.

Explain how a laser beam could be used to measure a distance of 2 meters.

Laser beam could be used to measure a distance of 2 meters by measuring the time it takes for the laser beam to travel that distance. The speed of the laser beam is the speed of light, which is 300,000 km/sec. So, in 1 sec, the laser beam will travel 300,000 km. In 2 sec, the laser beam will travel 600,000 km.

If the laser beam takes 2 sec to travel 2 meters, then the distance is 2 meters.

Explain the following terms that are used in the study of relativity: spacetime, coordinate system, four-vector, scalar, vector, velocity, acceleration, space-time interval, gravitational redshift, Hubble's constant, Big Bang.

A spacetime is a four-dimensional space, which is made up of three spatial dimensions plus one time dimension. A coordinate system is a set of coordinates, which are used to describe the position of a point in space, or space-time. A four-vector is a vector, which has four components. A scalar is a number, which has only one component. A vector is a number, which has two components. Velocity is the rate of change of position with respect to time. Acceleration is the rate of change of velocity with respect to time. Space-time interval is the distance between two points in space-time. Gravitational redshift is the phenomenon, when a light ray is observed to have a longer wavelength than it had before it was emitted. Hubble's constant is the rate at which the universe is expanding. Big Bang is the theory, according to which the universe originated from a single point, which was very hot and dense.

Explain the terms: time dilation, space dilation, proper acceleration.

Time dilation is a phenomenon that occurs in the theory of relativity, where the time interval in one frame of reference is greater than the time interval in another frame of reference. Space dilation is a phenomenon that occurs in the theory of relativity, where the space interval in one frame of reference is greater than the space interval in another frame of reference. Proper acceleration is the acceleration of an object on its proper axis.

Explain the terms: redshift, blue shift, gravitational redshift, time dilation.

Redshift is a phenomenon where the wavelength of light is increased. Blue shift is a phenomenon where the wavelength of light is decreased. Gravitational redshift is the phenomenon where light emitted from a source above the surface of the Earth is observed to have a longer wavelength than the light emitted from the same source below the surface of the Earth. Time dilation is the phenomenon where the time interval of an event in one frame of reference is greater than the time interval of the same event in another frame of reference.

Explain the following terms that are used in the study of relativity: relativity, relativity

According to relativity, all observers are equally valid, and there is no preferred reference frame. This means that all observers must agree on the laws of nature. The laws of nature are the same for all observers, regardless of their location and velocity.

In my post on Special relativity, I’ve explained the theory of special relativity as well as its real-world implications. As an introduction into the topic of general relativity, I’ve explained the basics of gravity and the equivalence principle. In this post, I will explain the theory of general relativity.

## Introduction

The theory of special relativity explains that spacetime is a continuum where time and space are interconnected. The theory states that the speed of light is constant in space. Thus, time slows down and distances contract when observed from a frame of reference that is moving relative to the observer.

One difficulty with the theory of special relativity is that, according to its postulates, the laws of physics remain the same in all frames of reference. This means, for example, that an observer cannot distinguish between gravitational field and acceleration. From the point of view of an astronaut, free-fall is experienced as weightlessness.

The theory does not explain why objects fall to the ground. And it does not explain why objects without mass can exert a gravitational effect on other objects.

Newton’s theory of gravity explained the attraction of the earth towards objects and its application had given us a lot of accurate results. However, the theory of gravity has never explained why gravity exists.

It was Albert Einstein who published his general theory of relativity in 1916, in which he explained the nature of gravity as a consequence of the curvature of spacetime. The theory was based on the concepts of special relativity and the laws of physics, as Einstein suggested.

## General relativity

In this theory, gravity can be explained in terms of the bending of spacetime. As described in the equivalence principle, there is no way for a free-falling observer to tell if he is falling in a gravitational field or if he is in an inertial frame of reference accelerating in a straight line. Because of this, Einstein reasoned that the presence of a gravitational field is equivalent to the existence of a curved spacetime.

General relativity is a theory of gravitation that was published by Albert Einstein in 1915. The theory states that gravity is a warping of spacetime, as described by the curvature of the spacetime. This theory asserts that the presence of a gravitational field is equivalent to the existence of a curved spacetime.

Einstein’s two postulates:

Einstein’s two postulates are:

1. Spacetime is a continuum where time and space are interconnected.
2. The laws of physics remain the same in all frames of reference, in conformity with the principle of relativity.

### Theory of general relativity

The theory of general relativity in general describes the curvature of spacetime by the presence of matter and energy. In regions where the matter or energy density is low, spacetime is flat, represented by a Minkowski space. In regions where there is a high density of matter, spacetime is strongly curved.

In the presence of a gravitational field, the theory predicts that clocks run more slowly and that space appears to contract when observed from a frame of reference that is moving relative to the observer.

Einstein’s theory predicts that the gravitational field is a direct consequence of the curvature of spacetime. The bending of a beam of light by the sun is the simplest example of this. The bending of light is explained by the presence of a strong gravitational field near the sun, which causes the light to be bent toward the center of the sun.

The theory also predicts that objects in free-fall accelerate toward the center of the sun, and that light is redshifted when traveling toward the sun.

### Testing general relativity

The theory of general relativity has been tested in a variety of ways, including the bending of light by the sun, the redshift of light from distant galaxies, and the gravitational redshift of light from the sun. The theory has also been tested in laboratory experiments, such as the Pound-Rebka experiment and the Gravity Probe A experiment.

In the Pound-Rebka experiment, the researchers measured the frequency of light emitted by a cesium atom in the gravitational field of the earth. They found that the frequency of the light was lower than the frequency of the light emitted by the same atom in a laboratory on the surface of the earth. This result was consistent with the predictions of general relativity.

In the Gravity Probe A experiment, the researchers measured the precession of gyroscopes in the gravitational field of the earth. They found that the precession of the gyroscopes was consistent with the predictions of general relativity.

The theory of general relativity has also been tested in observations of the cosmic microwave background radiation. The theory predicts that the radiation should be polarized in a certain way, and the observations have confirmed this prediction.

### General relativity and cosmology

The theory of general relativity has been used to explain many of the observations in cosmology. For example, the theory predicts that the universe is expanding and that the expansion is accelerating. The theory also predicts that the universe has a very low density of matter, which is consistent with the observations of the cosmic microwave background radiation.

The theory of general relativity has also been used to explain the formation of structures in the universe, such as galaxies and galaxy clusters. The theory predicts that the matter in the universe will cluster together to form structures, and the observations of the cosmic microwave background radiation have confirmed this prediction.

## Schwarzschild metric

The Schwarzschild metric is a mathematical description of the curvature of spacetime near a spherical object, such as a star or a black hole. The metric was first derived by Karl Schwarzschild in 1916, and it is one of the simplest and most important solutions to Einstein’s field equations.

The metric describes the curvature of spacetime in the vicinity of a spherical object, such as a star or a black hole. The metric is given by the following equation:

dS2 = – dt2 + dR2 + R2dΩ2

where dS is the infinitesimal distance between two points, dt is the infinitesimal time interval, dR is the infinitesimal radial coordinate, and dΩ is the infinitesimal solid angle.

The metric describes the curvature of spacetime in the vicinity of a spherical object. In the Schwarzschild metric, the time coordinate t is a function of the radial coordinate R, and the radial coordinate R is a function of the time coordinate t. The metric is axisymmetric, which means that it is invariant under rotations about the z-axis.

The Schwarzschild metric can be used to calculate the properties of a black hole, such as its mass, radius, and spin. The metric can also be used to calculate the deflection of light by a black hole, and the gravitational redshift of light from a black hole.

## Event horizon and singularities

The event horizon is the boundary of a black hole. It is the point of no return, beyond which nothing can escape the gravitational pull of the black hole. The event horizon is defined by the Schwarzschild radius, which is given by the following equation:

r = 2GM/c2

where G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass of the black hole, and c is the speed of light.

The Schwarzschild radius is the same as the event horizon for a non-rotating, non-charged black hole. However, for a rotating black hole or a black hole with an electric charge, the event horizon is shifted outward from the Schwarzschild radius.

The singularity is the point in spacetime where the curvature of spacetime is infinite. The singularity is the point at which the Schwarzschild metric breaks down. The singularity is also known as the “point of no return” because once a black hole has reached the singularity, it can never escape.

The singularity is the point at which the curvature of spacetime is infinite. This point is also known as the “point of no return” because once a black hole has reached the singularity, it can never escape. The singularity is also believed to be the point at which the laws of physics break down and become incomplete.

The singularity is not observable because it is hidden behind the event horizon. However, the area near the singularity is known as the “ergosphere”. The ergosphere is the point at which the curvature of spacetime is so strong that the laws of physics break down.

## Ergosphere

The ergosphere is the region of

Explain the theory of general relativity.

It is a theory proposed by Albert Einstein in 1915. According to theory, the first law of motion and the law of gravitation of Newton are no longer applicable. The deficiency of both the laws is overcome and unified by the theory. The theory deals with gravity as the result of curving of time and space so that both come under a single mathematical treatment. Gravity affects the behaviour and path of light.

Explain the curvature of space and time.

If the Earth is considered as a sphere, so the light ray passing through the Earth will be deflected. If we consider this as the motion of the planet Earth, we can say that the planet Earth is bending under the gravity of the Sun. In the same way, according to the theory of general relativity, the space-time around the planet Earth is getting bent under the influence of gravity. This is called curvature of space-time. It may be noted that this curvature is not appreciable near the Earth. This bending is appreciable near the Sun and the stars.

What is the curvature of space-time?

Any object is curved. A curved object is one whose shape is not straight but bent. A piece of paper can be bent. A curved object gives the illusion of two different directions. The curved object makes it difficult to decide which of the two directions is the straight one. In a curved space, the light beam will follow a trajectory in opposite directions.

Explain the relation between acceleration and gravity.

Acceleration is produced in a body by the application of a force. Any force applied to a body produces an acceleration. It may be noted that the force applied to a body can be due to gravity. Gravity is a force. Thus, gravity too can produce acceleration in a body. According to the theory of general relativity, gravity and acceleration are equivalent.

What is the difference between gravitational and inertial mass?

The physical property of a body, due to which it is attracted by the gravitational force, is called its gravitational mass. The physical property of a body, due to which it produces the gravitational force, is called its inertial mass.

Explain the gravitation.

An object attracts a different object. This attraction is called gravitation. It may be noted that gravitation is a force. It is a force which acts between two bodies. The magnitude of gravitation depends upon the masses of the two bodies and the distance between them.

What is the free fall?

A body that falls freely under the gravity of the Earth is called free fall. It may be noted that free fall is the motion of the body under the influence of gravity alone. The motion of a body near the Earth's surface is considered as a free fall.

What is the importance of gravitation?

All the planets, including the Earth, are held in their place by the gravitational attraction of the Sun. We cannot walk on the surface of the Earth without the gravitational force. All the stars and galaxies are held together by the gravitational force.

What is the similarity between gravitation and electromagnetic force?

Gravitation and electromagnetic force are similar in the following points:

(a) Both are action-at-a-distance forces.

(b) Both have long range.

(c) Both are non-contact forces.

Tell us about the Newton's law of gravitation.

Newton's law of gravitation states that, "Every body attracts every other body with a force that is directly proportional to the product of the masses of both the bodies and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them."

What are the shortcomings of Newton's law of gravitation?

The shortcomings of the Newton's law of gravitation are:

(a) It does not explain the motion of the planet Mercury.

(b) It does not explain the deflection of light by the gravitational field.

(c) It is not applicable to the motion of the stars.

What is the difference between the Newtonian mechanics and theory of general relativity?

Newtonian mechanics and theory of general relativity have the following differences:

(a) Newtonian mechanics applies only to the motion of the planets. The theory of general relativity applies to all the motion of the bodies.

(b) In Newtonian mechanics, the gravitational force is a universal gravitational force. In general relativity, the gravitational force is considered to be different for different bodies.

(c) In Newtonian mechanics, there is no acceleration due to gravity. In the theory of general relativity, acceleration is produced by the force of gravity.

What is the radius of curvature of the space-time around the Sun?

The radius of curvature of the space-time around the Sun is 1.5 × 10^{11} m.

What is the mass of the Sun?

The mass of the Sun is 2 × 10^{30} kg.

What is the force of gravity on the planet Earth?

The force of gravity on the planet Earth is 1 × 10^{11} N.

What is the radius of curvature of the space-time around the planet Earth?

The radius of curvature of the space-time around the planet Earth is 8.9 × 10^{6} m.

What is the mass of the planet Earth?

The mass of the planet Earth is 6 × 10^{24} kg.

What is the difference between gravitational and inertial mass?

The physical property of a body, due to which it is attracted by the gravitational force, is called its gravitational mass. The physical property of a body, due to which it produces the gravitational force, is called its inertial mass.

Give the relation between gravitational and inertial mass.

The ratio of the gravitational mass of a body to its inertial mass is the same for all the bodies. This ratio is called the constant of gravitation. The mathematical expression of the same is:

G = G_{0}

Where, G_{0} is the constant of gravitation.

What is the free fall?

A body that falls freely under the gravity of the Earth is called free fall. It may be noted that free fall is the motion of the body under the influence of gravity alone. The motion of a body near the Earth's surface is considered as a free fall.

What is the free fall?

A body that falls freely under the gravity of the Earth is called free fall. It may be noted that free fall is the motion of the body under the influence of gravity alone. The motion of a body near the Earth's surface is considered as a free fall.

Explain the theory of general relativity.

It is a theory proposed by Albert Einstein in 1915. According to theory, the first law of motion and the law of gravitation of Newton are no longer applicable. The deficiency of both the laws is overcome and unified by the theory. The theory deals with gravity as the result of curving of time and space so that both come under a single mathematical treatment. Gravity affects the behaviour and path of light.

What is the difference between gravitational and inertial mass?

The physical property of a body, due to which it is attracted by the gravitational force, is called its gravitational mass. The physical property of a body, due to which it produces the gravitational force, is called its inertial mass.

Define the acceleration due to gravity.

The acceleration produced in the body by the gravitational force is called acceleration due to gravity.

What is the acceleration due to gravity on the surface of the Earth?

The acceleration due to gravity on the surface of the Earth is 9.8 m/s^{2}.

What is the acceleration due to gravity in the vacuum?

The acceleration due to gravity in the vacuum is 9.8 m/s^{2}.

The acceleration due to gravity on the surface of Mars is 3.7 m/s^{2}.

What is the acceleration due to gravity on the surface of the Sun?

The acceleration due to gravity on the surface of the Sun is 274 m/s^{2}.

What is the gravitational constant?

The gravitational constant is the ratio of the gravitational force acting on a body of unit mass to the unit distance from the centre of the body. The mathematical expression of the same is:

G = G_{0} = 6.67 × 10^{-11} m^{3} kg^{-1} s^{-2}

What is the Newton's law of gravitation?

Newton's law of gravitation states that, "Every body attracts every other body with a force that is directly proportional to the product
